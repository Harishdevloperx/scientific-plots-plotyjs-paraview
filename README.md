This project is a web-based scientific data visualization tool built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Plotly.js, and PapaParse. It allows users to upload CSV files and generate a wide variety of 2D and 3D scientific plots interactively.

Features

Upload and parse CSV files directly in the browser

Dynamic column selection for X, Y, and Z axes

Supports multiple chart types:

Scatter, Line, Bar, Box

3D Scatter, 3D Line, Surface, Mesh, Tri-Surface

Heatmap, Contour, Ternary, Polar

Parallel Coordinates

Vector field plots (Cone, Streamtube, Isosurface)

Interactive zoom, pan, rotate, and hover using Plotly

Clean and responsive UI with modern styling

Technologies Used

Plotly.js – Interactive plotting library

PapaParse.js – CSV parsing

HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript – Frontend structure and logic

Project Use Case

This tool is useful for:

Scientific and engineering data analysis

Visualization of simulation results (ParaView → Plotly concept)

Academic projects and research presentations

Interactive dashboards for large datasets

Future Enhancements

Multiple traces on same graph

Real-time data streaming

Export plots as images/PDF

Integration with ParaView output directly

Theme switch (dark/light)

Author

Developed as part of a scientific visualization project using Plotly to extend advanced plotting similar to ParaView for web-based interactive analysis.
